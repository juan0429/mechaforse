Good morning, my name is Juan Diego Hernandez and my partner Thomas Cuellar from the La Salle Panama group (Mech Force). We made this robot project in a mobile car model to demonstrate the force,
mechanics, process and effort it takes to create a mobile device. It was also designed to handle automatically and provide a basis for a dependent and functional robot form.
It is also a way to exemplify how a robot should be assembled, whether in terms of programming or construction. 
We also wanted to join future engineers to experience the effort of creating a robot and also what are the steps to follow or how creative one must be.
we did this project to learn and make our lives easier after school and also to try new experiences, also that robotics is a subject that personally and that of my group 
has interested us a lot and motivates us to continue trying and experimenting
our motivation was the movies and characters made from robots and cables like: cyborg, pacific rim and also robot fighting programs and others,
besides that this helps us academically and we like it in the term that it is fun and fascinating the programming and creation of these and it teaches us that life has very interesting things,
our robot started as a model based on a truck without a system that controlled the rotation of the front wheels and they were only attached to the robot 's engine from the bottom,
then we modified the robot with a rotation system on its own axis and from there we were making small changes and reinforcing it with connections and others
our biggest difficulty is the rotation of the robot since apparently this is very heavy and the tires slip and does not They will guide well in addition to the fact that this one does not hold up
and the front wheels come off as it turns, this robot is based on one that I made with my team last year which was an Arduino, the current robot is a Lego spike made of a motor that turns two gears that move the robot forward and a forward turning movement 
that also uses a motor that is connected to a gear line and that has a conpe stick in front
a stick with small yeasts, our rear motor in a large angular motor for more momentum since it is the heaviest of all and in front a medium angular grio motor, in front of the robot there are three ultrasounds two on the sides of the robot and one in front of the robot, the one in front is the one that moves the robot to the right and the lateral ones to the left and right facilitating the detection of the walls, in addition the programming indicates a certain time in which they make the movement and how many cm they do it, the one in front is 100 cm and a lot since it is necessary for the robot to detect a wall long before to be able to make the turn in advance, the lateral ones at 35-50 cm since these do not have to detect as much as the front,
